Python Strings
==============

Python has a built-in string class named "str" with many handy features.
String literals can be enclosed by either double or single quotes, although
single quotes are more commonly used.

```python
'Hello'
"Hello"
```

Backslash escapes work the usual way within both single and double quoted
literals -- e.g. \\n \\' \\".

```python
print 'first\nsecond'
print 'I didn\'t do it'
```

A double quoted string literal can contain single quotes without any fuss (e.g.
`"I didn't do it"`) and likewise single quoted string can contain double quotes.

A string literal can span multiple lines, but there must be a backslash \\ at
the end of each line to escape the newline.  String literals inside triple
quotes, `"""` or `'''`, can span multiple lines of text.

Python strings are "immutable" which means they cannot be changed after they
are created. Since strings can't be changed, we construct \*new\* strings as we
go to represent computed values. So for example the expression `'hello' +
'there'` takes in the 2 strings 'hello' and 'there' and builds a new string
`'hellothere'`.

Characters in a string can be accessed using the standard `[ ]` syntax,
and like Java and C++, Python uses zero-based indexing, so if str is
`'hello'` `str[1]` is `'e'`.

If the index is out of bounds for the string, Python raises an error. The
Python style (unlike Perl) is to halt if it can't tell what to do, rather than
just make up a default value.

The handy "slice" syntax (below) also works to extract any substring from a
string. The `len(string)` function returns the length of a string. The `[ ]`
syntax and the `len()` function actually work on any sequence type -- strings,
lists, etc.. Python tries to make its operations work consistently across
different types.

*Python newbie gotcha:* don't use `len` as a variable name to avoid blocking
out the `len()` function.

The `+` operator can concatenate two strings. Notice in the code below that
variables are not pre-declared -- just assign to them and go.

```python
s = 'hi'
print s[1]          ## i
print len(s)        ## 2
print s + ' there'  ## hi there
```

Unlike Java, the '+' does not automatically convert numbers or other
types to string form. The str() function converts values to a string
form so they can be combined with other strings.

```python
pi = 3.14
text = 'The value of pi is ' + pi        ## No, does not work
text = 'The value of pi is '  + str(pi)  ## Yes
```

### Numbers

For numbers, the standard operators, `+`, `/`, `*` work in the usual way.
There is no `++` operator, but `+=`, `-=`, etc. work. If you want integer
division, it is most correct to use 2 slashes -- e.g. 6 // 5 is 1
(previous to python 3000, a single / does int division with ints anyway,
but moving forward // is the preferred way to indicate that you want int
division.)

### Printing

The "print" operator prints out one or more python items followed by a
newline (leave a trailing comma at the end of the items to inhibit the
newline).

A "raw" string literal is prefixed by an 'r' and passes all
the chars through without special treatment of backslashes, so r'x\\nx'
evaluates to the length-4 string 'x\\nx'. A 'u' prefix allows you to
write a unicode string literal (Python has lots of other unicode support
features -- see the docs below).

```python
raw = r'this\t\n and that'
print raw     ## this\t\n and that

text = 'this\t\n and that'
print text

multi = """It was the best of times.
It was the worst of times."""
```

### String Methods

Here are some of the most common string methods. A method is like a
function, but it runs "on" an object. If the variable `s` is a string,
then the code `s.lower()` runs the `lower()` method on that string object
and returns the result (this idea of a method running on an object is
one of the basic ideas that make up Object Oriented Programming, OOP).
Here are some of the most common string methods:

-   `s.lower()`, `s.upper()` -- returns the lowercase or uppercase version
    of the string
-   `s.strip()` -- returns a string with whitespace removed from the start
    and end
-   `s.isalpha()`/`s.isdigit()`/`s.isspace()`... -- tests if all the string
    chars are in the various character classes
-   `s.startswith('other')`, `s.endswith('other')` -- tests if the string
    starts or ends with the given other string
-   `s.find('other')` -- searches for the given other string (not a
    regular expression) within `s`, and returns the first index where it
    begins or `-1` if not found
-   `s.replace('old', 'new')` -- returns a string where all occurrences of
    `'old'` have been replaced by `'new'`
-   `s.split('delim')` -- returns a list of substrings separated by the
    given delimiter. The delimiter is not a regular expression, it's
    just text. `'aaa,bbb,ccc'.split(',')` -&gt; `['aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc']`.
    As a convenient special case `s.split()` (with no arguments) splits on
    all whitespace chars.
-   `s.join(list)` -- opposite of `split()`, joins the elements in the given
    list together using the string as the delimiter. e.g.
    `'---'.join(['aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc'])` -&gt; `'aaa---bbb---ccc'`

A google search for "python str" should lead you to the official
[python.org string
methods](http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)
which lists all the str methods.

Python does not have a separate character type. Instead an expression
like `s[8]` returns a string-length-1 containing the character. With
that string-length-1, the operators `==`, `<=`, ... all work as you would
expect, so mostly you don't need to know that Python does not have a
separate `char` type.

### String Slices

The "slice" syntax is a handy way to refer to sub-parts of sequences --
typically strings and lists. The slice `s[start:end]` is the elements
beginning at start and extending up to but not including end. Suppose we
have `s = "Hello"`

![the string 'hello' with letter indexes 0 1 2 3
4](images/hello.png)

-   `s[1:4]` is `'ell'` -- chars starting at index 1 and extending up to
    but not including index 4
-   `s[1:]` is `'ello'` -- omitting either index defaults to the start or
    end of the string
-   `s[:]` is `'Hello'` -- omitting both always gives us a copy of the
    whole thing (this is the pythonic way to copy a sequence like a
    string or list)
-   `s[1:100]` is `'ello'` -- an index that is too big is truncated down
    to the string length

The standard zero-based index numbers give easy access to chars near the
start of the string. As an alternative, Python uses negative numbers to
give easy access to the chars at the end of the string: s[-1] is the
last char `'o'`, `s[-2]` is `'l'` the next-to-last char, and so on. Negative
index numbers count back from the end of the string:

-   `s[-1]` is `'o'` -- last char (1st from the end)
-   `s[-4]` is `'e'` -- 4th from the end
-   `s[:-3]` is `'He'` -- going up to but not including the last 3 chars.
-   `s[-3:]` is `'llo'` -- starting with the 3rd char from the end and
    extending to the end of the string.

It is a neat truism of slices that for any index n,
`s[:n] + s[n:] == s`. This works even for n negative or out of bounds.
Or put another way `s[:n]` and `s[n:]` always partition the string into
two string parts, conserving all the characters. As we'll see in the
list section later, slices work with lists too.

### String %

Python has a printf()-like facility to put together a string. The %
operator takes a printf-type format string on the left (%d int, %s
string, %f/%g floating point), and the matching values in a tuple on the
right (a tuple is made of values separated by commas, typically grouped
inside parentheses):

```python
# % operator
text = "%d little pigs come out or I'll %s and %s and %s" % (3, 'huff', 'puff', 'blow down')
```

The above line is kind of long -- suppose you want to break it into
separate lines. You cannot just split the line after the '%' as you
might in other languages, since by default Python treats each line as a
separate statement (on the plus side, this is why we don't need to type
semi-colons on each line). To fix this, enclose the whole expression in
an outer set of parenthesis -- then the expression is allowed to span
multiple lines. This code-across-lines technique works with the various
grouping constructs detailed below: ( ), [ ], { }.

```python
  # add parens to make the long-line work:
  text = ("%d little pigs come out or I'll %s and %s and %s" %
    (3, 'huff', 'puff', 'blow down'))
```

### Unicode ðŸ˜€

Regular Python strings are \*not\* unicode, they are just plain bytes.
To create a unicode string, use the 'u' prefix on the string literal:

```python
> ustring = u'A unicode \u018e string \xf1'
> ustring
u'A unicode \u018e string \xf1'
> print ustring
A unicode ÆŽ string Ã±
```

A unicode string is a different type of object from regular "str"
string, but the unicode string is compatible (they share the common
superclass "basestring"), and the various libraries such as regular
expressions work correctly if passed a unicode string instead of a
regular string.

To convert a unicode string to bytes with an encoding such as 'utf-8',
call the ustring.encode('utf-8') method on the unicode string. Going the
other direction, the unicode(s, encoding) function converts encoded
plain bytes to a unicode string:

```python
> s = ustring.encode('utf-8')
> s
'A unicode \xc6\x8e string \xc3\xb1'  ## bytes of utf-8 encoding
> t = unicode(s, 'utf-8')             ## Convert bytes back to a unicode string
> t == ustring                      ## It's the same as the original, yay!
True
```

The built-in print does not work fully with unicode strings. You can
encode() first to print in utf-8 or whatever. In the file-reading
section, there's an example that shows how to open a text file with some
encoding and read out unicode strings. Note that unicode handling is one
area where Python 3 is significantly cleaned up vs. Python 2.x
behavior described here.

If Statement
------------

Python does not use { } to enclose blocks of code for if/loops/function
etc.. Instead, Python uses the colon (:) and indentation/whitespace to
group statements. The boolean test for an if does not need to be in
parenthesis, and it can have `elif` and
`else` clauses (mnemonic: the word `elif` is the same length as the
word `else`).

Any value can be used as an if-test. The "zero" values all count as
`false`: `None`, `0`, `''`, empty list `[]`, empty dictionary `{}`. There is
also a Boolean type with two values: `True` and `False` (converted to an
int, these are `1` and `0`).

Python has the usual comparison operations: `==`,
`!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`.

The boolean operators are the spelled out
words `and`, `or`, `not` (Python does not use the C-style && ||
!). Here's what the code might look like for a policeman pulling over a
speeder -- notice how each block of then/else statements starts with a :
and the statements are grouped by their indentation:

```python
if speed >= 80:
    print 'License and registration please'
    if mood == 'terrible' or speed >= 100:
        print 'You have the right to remain silent.'
    elif mood == 'bad' or speed >= 90:
        print "I'm going to have to write you a ticket."
    else:
        print "Let's try to keep it under 80 ok?"
```

I find that omitting the ":" is my most common syntax mistake when
typing in the above sort of code, probably since that's an additional
thing to type vs. my C++/Java habits. Also, don't put the boolean test
in parens -- that's a C/Java habit. If the code is short, you can put
the code on the same line after ":", like this (this applies to
functions, loops, etc. also), although some people feel it's more
readable to space things out on separate lines.

```python
if speed >= 80: print 'You are so busted'
else: print 'Have a nice day'
```
