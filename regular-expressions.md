Python Regular Expressions
==========================

Regular expressions are a powerful language for matching text patterns.
This page gives a basic introduction to regular expressions themselves
sufficient for our Python exercises and shows how regular expressions
work in Python. The Python "re" module provides regular expression
support.

In Python a regular expression search is typically written as:

```python
import re
match = re.search(pat, str)
```

The re.search() method takes a regular expression pattern and a string
and searches for that pattern within the string. If the search is
successful, search() returns a match object or None otherwise.
Therefore, the search is usually immediately followed by an if-statement
to test if the search succeeded, as shown in the following example which
searches for the pattern 'word:' followed by a 3 letter word (details
below):

```python
import re
str = 'an example word:cat!!'
match = re.search(r'word:\w\w\w', str)
if match:
    print('found', match.group())
else:
    print('did not find')
```

The code `match = re.search(pat, str)` stores the search result in a
variable named `match`. Then the if-statement tests the match -- if true
the search succeeded and `match.group()` is the matching text (e.g.
'word:cat'). Otherwise if the match is false (None to be more specific),
then the search did not succeed, and there is no matching text.

The `'r'` at the start of the pattern string designates a python "raw" string
which passes through backslashes without change which is very handy for regular
expressions. I recommend that you always write pattern strings with the `'r'`
just as a habit.

Basic Patterns
--------------

The power of regular expressions is that they can specify patterns, not
just fixed characters. Here are the most basic patterns which match
single chars:

-   `a`, `X`, `9`, `<` -- ordinary characters just match themselves exactly.
    The meta-characters which do not match themselves because they have
    special meanings are: `. \^ \$ \* + ? { \[ \] \\ | ( )`
    (details below)
-   `.` (a period) -- matches any single character except newline '\\n'
-   `\w` -- (lowercase w) matches a "word" character: a letter or digit
    or underscore `[a-zA-Z0-9\_]`. Note that although "word" is the
    mnemonic for this, it only matches a single word char, not a
    whole word. `\W` (upper case W) matches any non-word character.
-   `\b` -- boundary between word and non-word
-   `\s` -- (lowercase s) matches a single whitespace character -- space,
    newline, return, tab, form `[ \n\r\t\f]`. `\S` (upper case S)
    matches any non-whitespace character.
-   `\t`, `\n`, `\r` -- tab, newline, return
-   `\d` -- decimal digit `[0-9]` (some older regex utilities do not
    support but `\d`, but they all support `\w` and `\s`)
-   `^` = start, `$` = end -- match the start or end of the string
-   `\` -- inhibit the "specialness" of a character. So, for example,
    use `\.` to match a period or `\\` to match a slash. If you are
    unsure if a character has special meaning, such as `@`, you can put
    a slash in front of it, `\@`, to make sure it is treated just as
    a character.

Basic Examples
--------------

Joke: what do you call a pig with three eyes? piiig!

The basic rules of regular expression search for a pattern within a
string are:

-   The search proceeds through the string from start to end, stopping
    at the first match found
-   All of the pattern must be matched, but not all of the string
-   If `match = re.search(pat, str)` is successful, match is not `None`
    and in particular `match.group()` is the matching text

```python
import re

## Search for pattern 'iii' in string 'piiig'.
## All of the pattern must match, but it may appear anywhere.
## On success, match.group() is matched text.
match = re.search(r'iii', 'piiig')
match.group()

match = re.search(r'igs', 'piiig')
print(match)

## . = any char but \n
match = re.search(r'..g', 'piiig')
match

## \d = digit char, \w = word char
match = re.search(r'\d\d\d', 'p123g')
match.group()

match = re.search(r'\w\w\w', '@@abcd!!')
match.group()
```

Repetition
----------

Things get more interesting when you use `+` and `*` to specify repetition
in the pattern

-   `+` -- 1 or more occurrences of the pattern to its left, e.g. 'i+' =
    one or more i's
-   `*` -- 0 or more occurrences of the pattern to its left
-   `?` -- match 0 or 1 occurrences of the pattern to its left

### Leftmost & Largest

First the search finds the leftmost match for the pattern, and second it
tries to use up as much of the string as possible -- i.e. `+` and `*` go as
far as possible (the `+` and `*` are said to be "greedy"). 

Repetition Examples
-------------------

```python
import re

## i+ = one or more i's, as many as possible.
match = re.search(r'pi+', 'piiig')

## Finds the first/leftmost solution, and within it drives the +
## as far as possible (aka 'leftmost and largest').
## In this example, note that it does not get to the second set of i's.
match = re.search(r'i+', 'piigiiii')

## \s* = zero or more whitespace chars
## Here look for 3 digits, possibly separated by whitespace.
match = re.search(r'\d\s*\d\s*\d', 'xx1 2   3xx')
match = re.search(r'\d\s*\d\s*\d', 'xx12  3xx')
match = re.search(r'\d\s*\d\s*\d', 'xx123xx')

## ^ = matches the start of string, so this fails:
match = re.search(r'^b\w+', 'foobar')
## but without the ^ it succeeds:
match = re.search(r'b\w+', 'foobar')
```

Emails Example
--------------

Suppose you want to find the email address inside the string 
' purple alice-b@google.com monkey dishwasher'. We'll use this as a running example
to demonstrate more regular expression features. Here's an attempt using
the pattern r'\\w+@\\w+':

```python
import re
str = 'purple alice-b@google.com monkey dishwasher'
match = re.search(r'\w+@\w+', str)
if match:
    print(match.group())
```

The search does not get the whole email address in this case because the
`\w` does not match the `-` or `.` in the address. We'll fix this using
the regular expression features below.

### Square Brackets

Square brackets can be used to indicate a set of chars, so `[abc]`
matches 'a' or 'b' or 'c'. The codes `\w`, `\s` etc. work inside square
brackets too with the one exception that dot (`.`) just means a literal
dot. For the emails problem, the square brackets are an easy way to add
`.` and `-` to the set of chars which can appear around the `@` with the
pattern `r'[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+'` to get the whole email address:

```python
import re
str = 'purple alice-b@google.com monkey dishwasher'
match = re.search(r'[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+', str)
if match:
    print(match.group())
```

(More square-bracket features) You can also use a dash to indicate a
range, so `[a-z]` matches all lowercase letters. To use a dash without
indicating a range, put the dash last, e.g. `[abc-]`. An caret (up-hat) (`^`) at
the start of a square-bracket set inverts it, so `[^ab]` means any char
except 'a' or 'b'.

Group Extraction
----------------

The "group" feature of a regular expression allows you to pick out parts
of the matching text. Suppose for the emails problem that we want to
extract the username and host separately. To do this, add parenthesis `()`
around the username and host in the pattern, like this:
`r'([\w.-]+)@([\w.-]+)'`. In this case, the parenthesis do not
change what the pattern will match, instead they establish logical
"groups" inside of the match text. On a successful search,
`match.group(1)` is the match text corresponding to the 1st left
parenthesis, and `match.group(2)` is the text corresponding to the 2nd
left parenthesis. The plain `match.group()` is still the whole match text
as usual.

```python
str = 'purple alice-b@google.com monkey dishwasher'
match = re.search('([\w.-]+)@([\w.-]+)', str)
if match:
    print(match.group())   ## 'alice-b@google.com' (the whole match)
    print(match.group(1))  ## 'alice-b' (the username, group 1)
    print(match.group(2))  ## 'google.com' (the host, group 2)
```

A common workflow with regular expressions is that you write a pattern
for the thing you are looking for, adding parenthesis groups to extract
the parts you want.

findall
-------

`findall()` is probably the single most powerful function in the `re`
module. Above we used `re.search()` to find the first match for a pattern.
`findall()` finds *all* the matches and returns them as a list of
strings, with each string representing one match.

```python
## Suppose we have a text with many email addresses
str = 'purple alice@google.com, blah monkey bob@abc.com blah dishwasher'

## Here re.findall() returns a list of all the found email strings
emails = re.findall(r'[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+', str) ## ['alice@google.com', 'bob@abc.com']
for email in emails:
    # do something with each found email string
    print(email)
```

findall With Files
------------------

For files, you may be in the habit of writing a loop to iterate over the
lines of the file, and you could then call findall() on each line.
Instead, let findall() do the iteration for you -- much better! Just
feed the whole file text into findall() and let it return a list of all
the matches in a single step (recall that `f.read()` returns the whole
text of a file in a single string):

```python
# Open file
with open('foo.txt', 'r') as f:
  text = f.read()

strings = re.findall(r'another', text)
print(strings)
```

findall and Groups
------------------

The parenthesis `( )` group mechanism can be combined with `findall()`. If
the pattern includes 2 or more parenthesis groups, then instead of
returning a list of strings, `findall()` returns a list of \*tuples\*.
Each tuple represents one match of the pattern, and inside the tuple is
the group(1), group(2) .. data. So if 2 parenthesis groups are added to
the email pattern, then findall() returns a list of tuples, each length
2 containing the username and host, e.g. ('alice', 'google.com').

```python
str = 'purple alice@google.com, blah monkey bob@abc.com blah dishwasher'

tuples = re.findall(r'([\w\.-]+)@([\w\.-]+)', str)
print(tuples)

for tuple in tuples:
    print(tuple[0])
    print(tuple[1])
```
Once you have the list of tuples, you can loop over it to do some
computation for each tuple. If the pattern includes no parenthesis, then
`findall()` returns a list of found strings as in earlier examples. If the
pattern includes a single set of parenthesis, then `findall()` returns a
list of strings corresponding to that single group. (Obscure optional
feature: Sometimes you have paren `( )` groupings in the pattern, but
which you do not want to extract. In that case, write the parens with a
`?:` at the start, e.g. `(?: )` and that left paren will not count as a
group result.)

RE Workflow and Debug
---------------------

Regular expression patterns pack a lot of meaning into just a few
characters, but they are so dense, you can spend a lot of time
debugging your patterns. Set up your runtime so you can run a pattern
and print what it matches easily, for example by running it on a small
test text and printing the result of `findall()`. If the pattern matches
nothing, try weakening the pattern, removing parts of it so you get too
many matches. When it's matching nothing, you can't make any progress
since there's nothing concrete to look at. Once it's matching too much,
then you can work on tightening it up incrementally to hit just what you
want.

Options
-------

The `re` functions take options to modify the behavior of the pattern
match. The option flag is added as an extra argument to the `search()` or
`findall()` etc., e.g. `re.search(pat, str, re.IGNORECASE)`.

-   `IGNORECASE` -- ignore upper/lowercase differences for matching, so
    'a' matches both 'a' and 'A'.
-   `DOTALL` -- allow dot (`.`) to match newline -- normally it matches
    anything but newline. This can trip you up -- you think `.*` matches
    everything, but by default it does not go past the end of a line.
    Note that `\s` (whitespace) includes newlines, so if you want to
    match a run of whitespace that may include a newline, you can just
    use `\s*`
-   `MULTILINE` -- Within a string made of many lines, allow `^` and `$` to
    match the start and end of each line. Normally `^/$` would just
    match the start and end of the whole string.

Greedy vs. Non-Greedy (optional)
--------------------------------

This is optional section which shows a more advanced regular expression
technique not needed for the exercises.

Suppose you have text with tags in it: 

    <b>foo</b> and <i>so on</i>

Suppose you are trying to match each tag with the pattern
`(<.*>)` -- what does it match first?

The result is a little surprising, but the greedy aspect of the `.*`
causes it to match the whole `<b>foo</b>` and `<i>so
on</i>` as one big match. The problem is that the `.*` goes as far
as is it can, instead of stopping at the first `>` (aka it is
"greedy").

There is an extension to regular expression where you add a `?` at the
end, such as `.*?` or `.+?`, changing them to be non-greedy. Now they stop
as soon as they can. So the pattern `(<.*?>)` will get just
`<b>` as the first match, and `</b>` as the second match,
and so on getting each `<..>` pair in turn. The style is typically
that you use a `.*?`, and then immediately its right look for some
concrete marker (`>` in this case) that forces the end of the `.*?` run.

The `*?` extension originated in Perl, and regular expressions that
include Perl's extensions are known as Perl Compatible Regular
Expressions -- pcre. Python includes pcre support. Many command line
utils etc. have a flag where they accept pcre patterns.

An older but widely used technique to code this idea of "all of these
chars except stopping at X" uses the square-bracket style. For the above
you could write the pattern, but instead of `.*` to get all the chars,
use `[^<]*` which skips over all characters which are not `>` (the
leading `^` "inverts" the square bracket set, so it matches any char not
in the brackets).

**Nothing in the previous section should be taken as meaning you can parse HTML with regular expressions, 
[because you can't](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454).**

Substitution (optional)
-----------------------

The `re.sub(pat, replacement, str)` function searches for all the
instances of pattern in the given string, and replaces them. The
replacement string can include `'\1'`, `'\2'` which refer to the text from
`group(1)`, `group(2)`, and so on from the original matching text.

Here's an example which searches for all the email addresses, and
changes them to keep the user (`\1`) but have yo-yo-dyne.com as the host.

```python
str = 'purple alice@google.com, blah monkey bob@abc.com blah dishwasher'
## re.sub(pat, replacement, str) -- returns new string with all replacements,
## \1 is group(1), \2 group(2) in the replacement
print(re.sub(r'([\w\.-]+)@([\w\.-]+)', r'\1@yo-yo-dyne.com', str))
```
