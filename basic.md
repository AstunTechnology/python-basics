Basic Python Exercises
======================

There are 3 exercises that go with the first sections of Google's Python
class. They are located in the "basic" directory within the
google-python-exercises directory. Download the
[google-python-exercises.zip](https://github.com/AstunTechnology/python-basics-exercises/archive/master.zip)
if you have not already (see the
[Set-Up](set-up) page for
details).

In all of the following you can see how you are doing by running the file, e.g.
`python3 string1.py` - the `manin` method will run some tests and print out if
your code produces the right answer. Look for the string `# +++your code here+++` 
and replace it with your code, **save the file** and run it again to see if you
are getting closer.

**string1.py** -- complete the string functions in string1.py, based
on the material in the [Python Strings](strings) section (additional
exercises available in string2.py)

**list1.py** -- complete the list functions in list1.py, based on the
material in the [Python
Lists](lists) and [Python
Sorting](sorting) sections
(additional exercises available in list2.py)

**wordcount.py** -- this larger, summary exercise in wordcount.py
combines all the basic Python material in the above sections plus
[Python Dicts and
Files](dict-files) (a second
exercise is available in mimic.py)

With all the exercises, you can take a look at our solution code inside
the solution subdirectory.
