Basic Python Exercises
======================

There are 3 exercises that go with the first sections of Google's Python
class. They are located in the "basic" directory within the
google-python-exercises directory. Download the
[google-python-exercises.zip](google-python-exercises.zip)
if you have not already (see the
[Set-Up](set-up.md) page for
details).

**string1.py** -- complete the string functions in string1.py, based on
the material in the [Python
Strings](strings.md) section
(additional exercises available in string2.py)

**list1.py** -- complete the list functions in list1.py, based on the
material in the [Python
Lists](lists.md) and [Python
Sorting](sorting.md) sections
(additional exercises available in list2.py)

**wordcount.py** -- this larger, summary exercise in wordcount.py
combines all the basic Python material in the above sections plus
[Python Dicts and
Files](dict-files.md) (a second
exercise is available in mimic.py)

With all the exercises, you can take a look at our solution code inside
the solution subdirectory.
